# Summary

Robot Gladiators is a browser-based game. Although it is a MVP(minimal viable product), this app is monumental in teaching foundational Javascript concepts such as: loops, arrays, objects, functions, and callback functions.

## Usage

Created as the in-class project at UTSA to teach foundational Javascript.
